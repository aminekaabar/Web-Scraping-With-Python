# Web Scraping With Python
Web scraping is used to collect large information from websites. Here a simple python script using Selenium framework to extract & download data (tournaments details) from the ITF World Tennis Tour Calendar website into a CSV file.

# Why selenium?
Selenium is a framework designed to automate the testing of web applications.
You can then write a python script to automatically control browser interactions such as link clicks and form submissions. However, Selenium is useful when we want to extract data from javascript generated content of a web page. This is when the data appears after many ajax requests. Nevertheless, BeautifulSoup and scrapy are perfectly capable of extracting data from a web page. The choice of the library comes down to how the data on that particular web page is rendered.

# Setting up:
1- run command: pip install selenium
2- Download & install the browser driver to simulate browser sessions: 
   For Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
